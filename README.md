# Friendly DeepQ
[Website](https://greydanus.github.io/friendly_deepq/index.html)

This is a project I designed in order to study how DeepQ networks learn to interact with other agents. The reinforcement learning JavaScript library and much of the world's physics taken from work by Andrej Karpathy.

## Details
This machine learning project is built purely in JavaScript. As such, it is not optimized for speed. Instead, it is meant to serve as a toy example with which you can easily test out ideas before implementing them more rigorously with a library like Theano, Torch, or Keras.
