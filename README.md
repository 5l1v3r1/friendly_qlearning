# Reinforcement learning workshop
[Website](https://samjgrey3.github.io/reinforcejs-workshop/index.html)

Library taken from Karpathy's [reinforce.js](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs). My goal here is to take the excellent library written by Karpathy and apply reinforcement to some interesting and creative situations.

Also see the [main webpage](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs) for Karpathy's excellent demos

# Update:
I started building another completely unrelated project on this website, so it's sort of turning into a general workspace for my javascript projects. Thes new project is pretty cool - pretty much, it's about adding dynamics to fractals to eventually simulate chaotic systems such as trees blowing in the wind.
